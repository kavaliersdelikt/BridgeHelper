# BridgeHelper

**Get live feedback on your timing to help you master speed-bridging.**

Ever wondered why your speed-bridging feels inconsistent? Most mods tell you *after* you fall. **BridgeHelper** shows you exactly when to click *while* you're building. 

By tracking your raw keyboard input, we calculate your timing window down to the millisecond—meaning our feedback is always synced to your actual movement, not just the game's ticks. Whether you use the technical millisecond view or the easy 'User Friendly' messages, BridgeHelper helps you find your rhythm and stick to it.

## 🚀 Why professionals use BridgeHelper

- **Zero Guesses**: Real-time physics models calculate your ideal placement window based on your actual velocity.
- **Sub-Tick Accuracy**: We catch your 'unsneak' the moment it happens, providing feedback before the game even processes the next tick.
- **Completely Customizable**: Move the HUD, change colors, or toggle sound cues to fit your setup perfectly.
- **Learn Faster**: The instant visual and auditory feedback builds muscle memory significantly faster than solo practice.
